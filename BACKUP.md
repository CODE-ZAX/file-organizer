```python
backups = backup_manager.list_backups()
for backup in backups:
    print(f"Name: {backup['backup_name']}")
    print(f"Size: {backup['size_mb']} MB")
    print(f"Files: {backup['file_count']}")
```

#### Delete Backup

```python
success = backup_manager.delete_backup("backup_name")
```

#### Cleanup Old Backups

deleted_count = backup_manager.cleanup_old_backups(keep_count=10)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Backup Safety Features

### Data Integrity

- **ZIP Format**: Standard, reliable compression
- **Metadata**: Backup information stored separately
- **Verification**: File count and size tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management

### Storage Safety

- **No Overwrite**: Backups never overwrite existing files
- **Confirmation**: Delete operations require confirmation
- **Metadata**: Backup information preserved
- **Recovery**: Deleted backups can be recovered from trash

## üìà Best Practices

### Backup Strategy

- **Regular Backups**: Create backups before major changes
- **Incremental**: Keep multiple versions of important files
- **Cleanup**: Regularly clean up old backups
- **Testing**: Test restore functionality periodically

### Storage Management

- **Monitor Usage**: Check storage usage regularly
- **Cleanup**: Remove old backups when storage is full
- **Organization**: Use descriptive backup names
- **Location**: Keep backups in accessible location

### File Organization

- **Before Backup**: Organize files before backing up
- **After Restore**: Verify restored files
- **Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Keep notes about important backups

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backup Creation Fails

- **Check Permissions**: Ensure write access to backup directory
- **Check Space**: Verify sufficient disk space
- **Check Path**: Ensure source path exists
- **Check Name**: Use valid backup name

#### Restore Fails

- **Check Backup**: Verify backup file exists and is valid
- **Check Target**: Ensure restore location is writable
- **Check Space**: Verify sufficient disk space
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions

#### Storage Issues

- **Cleanup**: Use cleanup function to remove old backups
- **Location**: Move backups to different location
- **Compression**: Backups are already compressed
- **Monitoring**: Check storage usage regularly

### Error Messages

#### "Permission Denied"

- **Solution**: Check file/folder permissions
- **Fix**: Run as administrator or change permissions

#### "Insufficient Space"

- **Solution**: Free up disk space
- **Fix**: Delete old backups or move to different drive

#### "Backup Not Found"
